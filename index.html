                        <p>You can call me Danni (<span>“The WingNut”</span>) Lewis and one of my passions in life is to rate chicken wings.  At every eating establishment no matter the cuisine, if wings are on the menu then they are apart of my order.  Maybe it’s an addiction but <span>everybody</span> loves wings!  
                        </p>
                        <p>I’ve been to many places around the world thanks to my previous military career.  Some of the overseas places include South Korea, Japan, Italy, Germany, Alaska and finally Iraq.  I’ve found wings (or some form of wings) in all of these places with the exception of Iraq (I don’t count the wings that are brought in from outside of Iraq for the troops).  
                        No matter the currency; &cent; &pound; &yen; or &euro;, I was sure to try the wings.
                        </p>
                        <p>Inside of the U.S. I’ve visited many states and I’m positive that I’ve tried wings in every state visited but have forgotten to keep track.  So I’ve decided that I would start by rating and tracking local wings in my hometown of St. Louis, Missouri.

                    <img src="images/GastropubRetreat.jpg" alt="Gastropub Retreat"><br>
                    Coming in last but not least on my list is this awesome little joint near St. Louis University called the Gastropub Retreat.  It has a nice and peaceful environment
                    similar to that of a coffee house but with a full menu of food with a different angle.  The wings here are a dry rub and are very flavorful with a hint of smoke.
                    Definetely worth a visit.

                    <a href="https://st-charles.firebirdsrestaurants.com/">Firebirds</a>
                     is a nifty place with a menu that is filled with flavor.  The wings here are complete with the taste of the fire grill.

                    <img src="images/Outback.png" alt="Outback Steakhouse"><br>
                    Known for steak and blooming onions, I'd recently added Outback to my list of awesome wings just within the last couple of years.  Normally I would devour steak
                    from this joint and would not expect the wings to be so good and this place is the reason why wings are always part of my order, no matter what the 
                    restaurant is known for or its cuisine.  <a href="https://www.outback.com/">Outback</a> is holding steady at #6.

                    <a href="http://prasinostcharles.com/">Prasino</a> has a menu that is filled with delicious entrees but the wings are a nice addition as there are only a few per order.
                    Even though the number of wings is small, they are definitely derserving of a spot on this list.

                    <img src="images/BigAs.JPG" alt="Big A's On The Riverfront"><br>
                    Big A's has rubs on their wings that ring through the meat causing them to melt in your mouth.  The order is large and you will get your moneys worth.  While
                    you are there, pair your Memphis rub wings with a nice IPA.

                    <img src="images/Bombshell.jpg" alt="Bombshell Bar and Grill"><br>
                    The environment at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BombshellBarAndGrill/">Bombshell</a> is similar to Big A's on the Riverfront since it's a nice local spot on
                    St. Charles main street but the wings are different with the right amount of batter and many flavors to choose from.  The environment is that of a 
                    corner bar and the people are nice.

                    <img src="images/Mack's.jpg" alt="Mack's Chicken"><br>
                    Coming in at #2 is Mack's Chicken that has chicken that is better than Popeye's.  The wings are of the same seasoning as the other chicken
                    entrees so order a wing plate or a chicken plate and you won't be disappointed.

                        <img src="images/Lucky's.jpg" alt="Lucky's Bar and Grill"><br>
                        At #1 is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LuckysBarAndGrill1">Lucky's</a> and unfortunately for me, all of the nearby locations have closed.  
                        There's still a Lucky's left on the east side of the Mississippi river in Belleville and is definitely worth an hour drive for the perfectly
                        roasted falling off of the bone and nicely seasoned garlic wings.  Until that last location closes, it will remain as the top spot for wings
                        in this area.  Enjoy!
